## Scoring System

- Each correct answer = 100 points
- Winner determined by:
  1. **Highest score** (correct * 100)
  2. **Fastest time** (if scores are equal)
  3. **Draw** (if both score and time are equal)

---

## Error Handling

### Disconnection Scenarios

1. **During Queue**: Player is removed from queue
2. **During Game**: Opponent receives `OPPONENT_DISCONNECTED` and wins by default
3. **Reconnection**: If player reconnects within the game timeout (typically 30s), they restore to their room state

### Client-Side Validation

- Check `answer` against `question.correctAnswer` before submitting
- Track `timeMs` from when question is displayed to when answer is submitted
- Validate `roomId` and `userId` before each submission

---

## Best Practices

✅ Send PING every 25 seconds to keep connection alive  
✅ Handle OPPONENT_DISCONNECTED gracefully (show results)  
✅ Track question timer locally for `timeMs` calculation  
✅ Validate user answers client-side before sending  
✅ Implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff  
✅ Show opponent progress in real-time via `answeredCount`
